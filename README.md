## Predict Breast Cancer using SageMaker’s Linear-Learner with features derived from images of Breast Mass
We have taken  UCI’S breast cancer diagnostic dataset. The purpose here is to use this data set to build a predictve model of whether a breast mass image indicates benign or malignant tumor. We will use aws SageMaker to build our moderl.
Amazon SageMaker helps data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality ML models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for ML.
